# # Question 1
# # Write a Python program that checks if a swimmerâ€™s time is under 60 seconds and prints whether they qualify.
# swimTime = float(input("Enter your swim time: "))
# if swimTime < 60.0:
#     print("Participant qualifies. ")

# # Write a Python program that categorises swimmers into Gold, Silver, Bronze, or Not Qualified based on their times.

# swimTime = float(input("Enter your swim time: "))
# if swimTime < 55.0:
#     print("Participant qualifies for gold category. ")

# # Question 3
# # Write a Python program that asks for freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly times, then prints which strokes the swimmer qualifies for.

# freestyleTime = float(input("Enter your freestyle time: "))
# backstrokeTime = float(input("Enter your backstroke time: "))

# if butterflyTime < 60:
#     print("You have qualified for butterfly. ")
# else:
#     print("You have not qualified for butterfly. ")


# # Question 4
# # Write a Python program that uses conditional logic to check if a swimmer qualifies for multiple strokes at once (e.g., Freestyle and Backstroke, Freestyle and Butterfly).

# freestyleTime = float(input("Enter your freestyle time: "))
# backstrokeTime = float(input("Enter your backstroke time: "))

#     print("You qualified for freeestyle and backstroke")

#     # not done


# # Question 5
# # Write a Python program that assigns values to variables representing the temperature and whether it is sunny. Check if the temperature is greater than 15 and it is sunny. Print the result.

# temp = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))
# weather = input("Is it sunny (Yes/No): ")

# if temp > 15.0 and weather == "Yes":
#     print("The weather is good today. ")
# else:
#     print("The weather is not that good today. ")


# Question 6
# Write a Python program that assigns values to variables representing the temperature and whether it is raining. Check if the temperature is greater than 15 or it is raining. Print the result.

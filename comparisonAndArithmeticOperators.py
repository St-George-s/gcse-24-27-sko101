# # Question 1 
# # Write a Python program to check if two numbers are equal.
# # Ask the user to input two numbers and print whether they are equal or not. 

# usersNumber1 = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

# # Question 2 
# # Write a Python program to find the larger of two numbers.
# # Ask the user to input two numbers and print the larger number. 

# usersNumberOne = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

# # Question 3 
# # Write a Python program to calculate the remainder when one number is divided by another.
# # Ask the user for two numbers and print the remainder. 

# usersNumber1One = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

# print("The remainder of your two numbers is: " + str(usersNumber1One % usersNumber2Two))


# # Question 4 
# # Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
# # Ask the user for a number and print the result.

# # Question 5 
# # Write a Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle.
# # Ask the user to input the length and width of the rectangle and print the area.

# # Question 6 
# # Write a Python program to check if one number is a multiple of another.
# # Ask the user to input two numbers and print whether the first number is a multiple of the second. 

# usersNumberOne1 = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
